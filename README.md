CatAccent
=======

Add a cat accent to your web browsing experience!

## To install in Firefox:
* Install [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), and restart the browser
* Click to open [CatAccent.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemkat/CatAccent/master/CatAccent.user.js) and install when prompted.
* Check the GreaseMonkey menu to make sure the user script is enabled.

## To install in Chrome:
* Download [CatAccent.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemkat/CatAccent/master/CatAccent.user.js) and ignore any warnings about not being able to install extensions from this site.
* Install [TamperMonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/), and install as a user script
* OR Visit `chrome://extensions` (enter that into the location bar) and drag the CatAccent.user.js file into the browser window, and drop it to install (this option doesn't work as well)

## Did it install correctly?
Do these sound like cat words to you?

* now
* new
* his
* baby
* dog

## That doesn't sound enough like a cat...
I fully agree. Please fork the [github repo](https://github.com/zemkat/CatAccent), make your improvements, and send me a pull request!
